Optimization Problem Solving - Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)

This algorithm finds approximate solutions to a MaxMin Diversity Problem (MMDP) using the metaheuristic GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure). Essentially, the MMDP problem involves selecting a number of elements from a set of elements such that the minimum distance between the selected elements is maximized.
